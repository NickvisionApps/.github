### What happened to Windows versions of apps?
https://nickvision.org/2023/05/23/removing-windows-support.html
> Windows is no longer a supported platform by Nickvision due to many issues with publishing our apps on the Microsoft Store and many issues with Microsoft as a whole.

> Nickvision apps can still by used by Windows users via Flatpak on WSL (recommended distro: OpenSuse)
